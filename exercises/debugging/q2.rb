# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# Further Exploration
# Is the FlightlessBird#initialize method necessary? Why or why not?
# FlightlessBird#initialize is unnecessary because it simply calls super
# which is equivalent to calling the Animal#initialize method. Since
# the FlightlessBird class inherits from the Animal superclass, there
# is no need to define a separate initialize method if there is no extra
# functionality needed
