  ---------- RULES ----------
  => OBJECTIVE:
  => The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible,
  => without going over. If you go over 21, it's a "bust" and an
  => immediate loss.

  => SETUP:
  => The game consists of a "dealer" and a "player". Both participants
  => are initially dealt 2 cards. The player can see both their cards,
  => but can initially see only the first of the dealer's cards,
  => with the second card (the "hole" card) hidden from the player.

  => CARD VALUES:
  => Card numbers 2-10 are worth their face value. Jacks, queens,
  => and kings are each worth 10. Aces are worth either 1 or 11,
  => depending on the player's hand: an ace is counted as 11 if
  => it does not cause the hand's value to exceed 21; otherwise,
  => it is counted as 1.

  ---------- RULES ----------
  => GAMEPLAY:
  => The player goes first and can choose to "hit" to add more cards
  => to their hand, or "stay" to keep their current hand. If their
  => hand's total exceeds 21, the player busts and loses.

  => If the player stays without busting, the dealer's turn begins.
  => The dealer must hit until their total hand is at least 17, at which
  => point they must stay. If the dealer busts, the player wins.

  => If both the player and dealer stay without busting, then the total value
  => of each hand is compared and the winner is the one with the highest
  => value. If the values are the same, it's a tie, resulting in a "push".
